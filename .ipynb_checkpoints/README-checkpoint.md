Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model which can predict the approval status of a loan application at a lending institution. Because the data is already labeled and there is a target feature, this is a supervised machine learning project. As there are only two discrete outcomes, this problem will require a classification algorithm.

This is an important global problem at any lending institution, as many people around the world do not currently have the funds to buy outright buy houses, cars, start a business, etc. Evaluating a loan application can be a time-consuming process for a person and a predition model can not only speed up the process, but also be more consistent and fair than a person or several people may be in the process. A prediction model will be far less expensive to create and maintain in the long-term, so that the costs to lending institutions and to borrowers will be reduced.
